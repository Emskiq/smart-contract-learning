# Smart Contracts examples

This repository will keep track of the example contracts, regardless of size or complexity, that I have completed during second step of _my Rust auditor path_ â€“ learning smart contract development and the basics of Rust auditing.

## Starting Point

I began by following [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7mnz6eNKsYlLiLfhDKtVjdSb59cBZPVL) of video tutorials, which introduced me to using [Ink!](https://use.ink/) and [Substrate](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/smart-contracts). The contracts covered in these tutorials include:

- [Simple Storage](SimpleStorage)
- [Flipper](flipper)
- [ERC-20](erc_20)
- [Incrementer](incrementer) - _skip it_

While these contracts are simple, they provide a solid foundation in understanding Ink! and the actual interaction with contracts through [`substrate-contracts-node`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node).
