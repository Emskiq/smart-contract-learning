# Smart contract examples and learning process

This repository will keep track of the example contracts (doesn't matter small, medium, large, complex, simple ones) that I have done during this step of my _Rust auditor path - learn SC development and basics of Rust auditing_.

## Starting point

Starting with [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7mnz6eNKsYlLiLfhDKtVjdSb59cBZPVL) of video tutorials, which will get you into using [Ink!](https://use.ink/) and [Substrate](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/smart-contracts). The contracts done in these tutorials are as follows:
- [Simple Storage](SimpleStorage)
- [Flipper](flipper)
- [ERC-20](erc_20)

They are simple ones, however will got you into the basics of Ink! and the actual interaction with contract through [`substrate-contracts-node`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node)
