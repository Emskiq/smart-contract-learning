# Simple Storage contract

Smart contract written in Rust and using [`near-sdk`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs).
This contract is showcasing how to use `struct` and the `near-sdk` crate to develop a simple favourite values storage.

> Note: Somehow version `5.0.0` and above of the `near-sdk` crate was causing issues with the example code showed in the video, so I had to use older version, which you can check in the [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml)
