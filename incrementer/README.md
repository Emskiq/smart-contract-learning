# Incrementer

Another smart contract written in Rust's [`ink!`](https://use.ink/how-it-works) framework. This is a simple incrementer and storage of an `integer` value.

Nothing crazy here apart from using a different value in the `ink(storage)`. This was an exercise for me personally to get comfortable with the framework.

This contract is developed by referring to [the official documentation](https://use.ink/getting-started/setup).

**I highly recommend following the official tutorial steps** to actually learn about the important tools that you will be using in the future.
