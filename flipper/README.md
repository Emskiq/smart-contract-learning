Smart contract written in Rust and more specifically [`ink!`](https://use.ink/how-it-works) - framework/language used for Rust SC development - simple storage of a `bool` value.

This contract is developed by following [the official tutorial](https://use.ink/getting-started/setup), since the contract showed in the [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98CIYL7FeDQ&list=PL7mnz6eNKsYlLiLfhDKtVjdSb59cBZPVL&index=2) is a similar one.

**I higly recommend doing the official tutorial steps** and actually learn about the imporant tools, that you will be using in the future.
